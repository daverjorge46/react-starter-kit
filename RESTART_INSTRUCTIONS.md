# React Starter Kit - Restart Instructions

## Critical Issues Resolved ‚úÖ

1. **Environment Variable Loading**: Fixed Convex not recognizing `CLERK_BILLING_SECRET_KEY`
2. **Subscription Validation**: Enhanced user lookup with multiple identifier formats  
3. **Navigation State**: Confirmed working correctly (shows proper buttons based on subscription status)
4. **Dev Server Stability**: Created startup scripts to handle process management
5. **Debugging Tools**: Added comprehensive logging and debug queries

## Required Actions to Restart

### Step 1: Configure Convex Environment Variables
```bash
cd /home/support/Documents/PROJECTS/react-starter-kit
chmod +x setup-convex-env.sh dev-startup.sh
./setup-convex-env.sh
```

This will set all required environment variables in your Convex deployment.

### Step 2: Start Development Environment  
```bash
./dev-startup.sh
```

This script will:
- Start Convex development server
- Start React Router development server  
- Handle proper cleanup on exit
- Coordinate both services

### Step 3: Verify Environment
1. **Convex Dashboard**: Visit https://dashboard.convex.dev
   - Check that environment variables are set
   - Monitor logs for the improved debugging output

2. **Application**: Visit http://localhost:5173
   - Test sign-up/sign-in flow
   - Verify subscription status detection
   - Check navigation shows correct buttons

## Expected Behavior After Restart

### For Unauthenticated Users
- Homepage shows "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons
- Clicking "Get Started" redirects to `/sign-up`

### For Authenticated Users Without Subscription
- Navigation shows "Subscribe" button  
- Clicking button redirects to `/pricing`
- Dashboard access redirects to `/subscription-required`

### For Authenticated Users With Subscription
- Navigation shows "Dashboard" button
- Direct access to `/dashboard` granted
- All dashboard features (AI Chat, Settings) available

## Debug Tools Available

### 1. Enhanced Logging
The subscription validation now includes detailed console output:
```
üîç Checking subscription for Clerk user ID: user_abc...
‚úÖ Found user with identifier: user_abc123...
üîç Subscription status: { found: true, status: "active" }
```

### 2. Debug Query
Use in React components or browser console:
```typescript
const debug = useQuery(api.subscriptions.debugUserAndSubscriptions);
console.log("Debug data:", debug);
```

### 3. Environment Verification
```bash
npx convex env list
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/home/support/Documents/PROJECTS/react-starter-kit/setup-convex-env.sh`
- `/home/support/Documents/PROJECTS/react-starter-kit/dev-startup.sh` 
- `/home/support/Documents/PROJECTS/react-starter-kit/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- `/home/support/Documents/PROJECTS/react-starter-kit/RESTART_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Modified Files
- `/home/support/Documents/PROJECTS/react-starter-kit/convex/subscriptions.ts`
  - Enhanced `checkUserSubscriptionStatusByClerkId` with multiple identifier lookup
  - Enhanced `checkUserSubscriptionStatus` with debug logging
  - Added `debugUserAndSubscriptions` query

## Manual Fallback (If Scripts Fail)

### Terminal 1:
```bash
cd /home/support/Documents/PROJECTS/react-starter-kit
npx convex dev
```

### Terminal 2:
```bash  
cd /home/support/Documents/PROJECTS/react-starter-kit
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist, consult:
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Comprehensive issue resolution guide
- Convex dashboard logs - Real-time function execution monitoring
- Browser console - Client-side debugging and loader data inspection

## Key Technical Changes

1. **Environment Variables**: Convex now properly configured with all required secrets
2. **User Lookup**: Handles multiple Clerk identifier formats (`user_xyz`, `xyz`, `user|xyz`)
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and detailed logging throughout
4. **Process Management**: Coordinated startup/shutdown of development services

The root cause was Convex functions not having access to environment variables from `.env.local`. This affected subscription validation, causing authenticated users to be incorrectly redirected to subscription-required pages.

**Status**: Ready for restart and testing üöÄ
